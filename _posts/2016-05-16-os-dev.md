I think [this](http://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones) is a good starting point to write your own
microkernel and learn how a OS bare bones work.
I started working on this soon after doing the OS lecture but could not finish
the project unfortunatelly.
It is also required to read
[Getting_Started](http://wiki.osdev.org/Getting_Started),
[Beginners_Mistakes](http://wiki.osdev.org/Beginner_Mistakes) and some
[OS_theory](http://wiki.osdev.org/Category:OS_theory) before.

A followup for the *Bare Bones* Tutorial is the
[Meaty_Skeleton](http://wiki.osdev.org/Meaty_Skeleton) which provides a
microkernel similar to the one of the *Bare Bones*.

Additionally a overview of all the tutorials can be found
[here](http://wiki.osdev.org/Tutorials).
